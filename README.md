## Eat-Da-Burger

## Description: "Eat-Da-Burger" assignment for coding bootcamp!

- Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of the burgers they'd like to eat.

- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, Eat-Da-Burger will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

- Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When you click it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

- Eat-Da-Burger will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
